# Introduction

Welcome to Estrela, a simple yet powerful, easy to use and boilerplate killer library for web applications.

Estrela is inspired by most of other frontend libraries like Angular, React, Vue, etc, and the reactivity system of RxJs. It was created to be a very simple and easy to use library, removing all the boilerplate code that we see in most libraries.

Estrela means "Star" in Portuguese and was designed by Brazilian Eduardo Rosostolato.
